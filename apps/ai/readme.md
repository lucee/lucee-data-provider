# Lucee Docker Setup with Custom Extensions

This repository demonstrates how to build a Lucee Docker image with custom extensions bundled.

## Files

### Dockerfile

Defines the Docker image for the Lucee server. It includes steps to copy website files, a custom Lucee configuration, and extensions into the appropriate directories.

### lucee-config.json

Contains the Lucee server configuration, including the definition of extensions. Extensions can be defined in various ways:

#### Example with Local Path

The extensions array can specify the path to the extension file within the container.

```json
"extensions": [
    {
        "id": "60772C12-F179-D555-8E2CD2B4F7428718",
        "name": "Redis",
        "path": "/opt/lucee/web/lucee-server/context/extensions/redis.extension-3.0.0.51.lex"
    }
]
```

- **id**: Optional, for Lucee 6.1 and beyond.
- **name**: Optional, makes it easier to read.
- **path**: Points to the local directory where the extension is located within the container.

#### Example with URL

The extensions array can also specify the URL from which to download the extension. Note that Lucee needs internet access to download the extension.

```json
"extensions": [
    {
        "id": "60772C12-F179-D555-8E2CD2B4F7428718",
        "url": "https://ext.lucee.org/redis.extension-3.0.0.51.lex"
    }
]
```

#### Example with Extension ID

You can define the extension only by its ID. Lucee will download the extension from the Extension Provider or directly from Maven, depending on the Lucee version.

```json
"extensions": [
    {
        "id": "60772C12-F179-D555-8E2CD2B4F7428718"
    }
]
```

### extensions/redis.extension-3.0.0.51.lex

The extension file itself. Place any extensions you want to bundle in this directory.

## Directory Structure

Your project directory should look like this:

```
your-project-directory/
│
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── lucee-config.json
├── www/
│   └── [your website files]
└── extensions/
    └── redis.extension-3.0.0.51.lex
```

## Usage

### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile` and run:

```sh
docker build -t lucee-with-config .
```

### Running the Docker Container

To run the Docker container, use the following command:

```sh
docker run -d -p 8054:80 -p 8854:8888 -e LUCEE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=qwerty lucee-with-config
```

This command will start the container, exposing port 80 for Nginx and port 8888 for Tomcat, with the Lucee admin password set to `qwerty`.

### Using Docker Compose

If you prefer to use Docker Compose, you can define the services and configurations in `docker-compose.yml`. Here is an example:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  lucee:
    build: .
    environment:
      - LUCEE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=qwerty
    volumes:
      - "./www:/var/www"
      - "./extensions:/opt/lucee/web/lucee-server/context/extensions"
    ports:
      - "8054:80"   # nginx
      - "8854:8888" # tomcat
```

To start the services, navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file and run:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

This will build and start the services in detached mode, exposing the necessary ports and setting the Lucee admin password.

## Summary

This setup provides a flexible way to configure and extend the Lucee server using Docker and Docker Compose.
